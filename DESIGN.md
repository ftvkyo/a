# d

Characters considered for the initial character of special form names:

## Colon `:`
```
The only symbol on the home row and looks nice.
(:if a b c)
```

## At `@`
Looks nice, ok to type.
```
(@if a b c)
```

## Hash `#`
Good enough, ok to type, often used for macros.
```
(#if a b c)
```

## Percent `%`
Good enough, a bit harder to type than `#`, often used for macros.
```
(%if a b c)
```

## Comma `,`
Easy to type, looks lame.
```
(,if a b c)
```

## Dot `.`
Easy to type, but may be used in identifiers or as a decimal point.
```
(.if a b c)
```

## Slash `/`
Controversial - used by many games and chats for commands but might look
bad and also is used in the division operator.
```
(/if a b c)
```
